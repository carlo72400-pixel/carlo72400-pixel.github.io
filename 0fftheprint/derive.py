"""
Build the small derivatives the page actually renders.

The site paints card art, avatars and catalog thumbs as CSS background-images
through paintBg()/CSSOM. That is the right call for security (an inline style
attribute lets an entity-escaped quote break out of url()), but it costs the
one thing <img loading="lazy"> gives you for free: the browser will not defer
an offscreen background, and there is no srcset to pick a smaller file.

So the page was shipping a 1125x1500, 608 KB card JPEG to paint a 42x42 avatar
circle. Four of those sit near the top of the timeline. Measured 2026-08-21 on
a 375px viewport at DPR 2: 4.4 MB of transfer, 98% of it images.

This writes two sizes next to the originals. Nothing is overwritten and no
original is touched.

    assets/av/<path>.jpg      96px   timeline avatars (42 CSS px at DPR 2 = 84)
    assets/thumb/<path>.jpg  440px   catalog desk thumbs (169 CSS px = 338)
    assets/card/<path>.jpg   760px   roster + curator cards in the GRID

The grid card art is the one that costs real money: four full-art JPEGs at
1125x1500 were loading on every page view to fill boxes 227 CSS px wide.
Measured on a 1440 desktop at DPR 2, the grid needs 454px and the modal needs
816px. So the grid gets 760 and the ORIGINAL is kept for the modal, which only
loads when somebody actually taps a card. renderPokeCard() picks by source.

Subfolders are mirrored, so assets/work/x.jpg derives to assets/thumb/work/x.jpg.

Run it from the 0fftheprint folder after adding or swapping any card art:

    /usr/bin/python3 derive.py            # only what is missing or stale
    /usr/bin/python3 derive.py --force    # rebuild everything

Then commit assets/av/ and assets/thumb/ along with the source image.
