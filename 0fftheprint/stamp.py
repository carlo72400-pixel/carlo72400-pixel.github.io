"""Cache-stamp the shared scripts by CONTENT, not by a hand-typed date.

Run this after touching assets/js/desk.js, assets/js/door.js or
supabase-config.js, before you commit:

    /usr/bin/python3 stamp.py

Why it exists: a hand-typed ?v=20260820 stamp got applied to desk.js and THEN
desk.js was rewritten. Same URL, different content, so every browser that had
already loaded the page kept serving the stale file out of cache and the new
methods simply did not exist. A date you have to remember to bump is a date you
forget to bump. The hash cannot drift from the file it names.
